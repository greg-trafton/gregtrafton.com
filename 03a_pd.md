<h3 id="perceived-danger">Perceived Danger</h3>
<hr><br>
We have developed a survey that measures perceived danger. We have also developed a shorted 4 item scale to measure perceived danger.  It is currently under review, but contact Greg if you need it.

A 6-point scale was used: 1 (Not at all) - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 (Extremely) (Questions randomized)
<b>Question wording:</b> Answer as if you were the person in the video.
